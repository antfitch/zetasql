# Anonymization aggregate functions

Anonymization aggregate functions can transform user data into anonymous
information. This is important if you don't want anyone to identify or
re-identify an individual user from the anonymized data.
Anonymization aggregate functions can only be used with
[anonymization-enabled queries][anon-syntax].

### ANON_AVG

```sql
ANON_AVG(expression [CLAMPED BETWEEN lower AND upper])
```

**Description**

Returns the average of non-`NULL`, non-`NaN` values in the expression.
This function first computes the average per anonymization ID, and then computes
the final result by averaging these averages.

You can [clamp the input values explicitly][anon-clamp], otherwise
input values are clamped implicitly. Clamping is done to the
per-anonymization ID averages.

`expression` can be any numeric input type, such as
INT64.

**Return type**

DOUBLE

**Examples**

The following anonymized query gets the average number of each item requested
per professor. Smaller aggregations may not be included. This query references
a view called [`view_on_professors`][anon-example-views].

```sql
-- With noise
SELECT
  WITH ANONYMIZATION OPTIONS(epsilon=10, delta=.01, kappa=1)
  item, ANON_AVG(quantity CLAMPED BETWEEN 0 AND 100) average_quantity
FROM view_on_professors
GROUP BY item;

-- These results will change each time you run the query.
-- Smaller aggregations may be removed.
+----------+------------------+
| item     | average_quantity |
+----------+------------------+
| pencil   | 38.5038356810269 |
| pen      | 13.4725028762032 |
+----------+------------------+
```

```sql
-- Without noise (this un-noised version is for demonstration only)
SELECT
  WITH ANONYMIZATION OPTIONS(epsilon=1e20, delta=.01, kappa=1)
  item, ANON_AVG(quantity) average_quantity
FROM view_on_professors
GROUP BY item;

-- These results will not change when you run the query.
+----------+------------------+
| item     | average_quantity |
+----------+------------------+
| scissors | 8                |
| pencil   | 40               |
| pen      | 18.5             |
+----------+------------------+
```

| pen      | 58       |
+----------+----------+
```

### CLAMPED BETWEEN clause 
<a id="anon_clamping"></a>

```sql
CLAMPED BETWEEN lower_bound AND upper_bound
```

Clamping of aggregations is done to avoid the re-identifiability
of outliers. The `CLAMPED BETWEEN` clause [explicitly clamps][anon-exp-clamp]
each aggregate contribution per anonymization ID within the specified range.
This clause is optional. If you do not include it in an anonymization aggregate
function, [clamping is implicit][anon-imp-clamp].

**Examples**

The following anonymized query clamps each aggregate contribution per
anonymization ID and within a specified range (`0` and `100`). As long as all
or most values fall within this range, your results will be accurate. This query
references a view called [`view_on_professors`][anon-example-views].

```sql
--Without noise (this un-noised version is for demonstration only)
SELECT
  WITH ANONYMIZATION OPTIONS(epsilon=1e20, delta=.01, kappa=1)
  gender, ANON_AVG(quantity CLAMPED BETWEEN 0 AND 100) average_quantity
FROM view_on_professors
GROUP BY item;

+----------+------------------+
| item     | average_quantity |
+----------+------------------+
| scissors | 8                |
| pencil   | 40               |
| pen      | 18.5             |
+----------+------------------+
```

Notice what happens when most or all values fall outside of the clamped range.
To get accurate results, ensure that the difference between the upper and lower
bound is as small as possible while most inputs are between the upper and lower
bound.

```sql {.bad}
--Without noise (this un-noised version is for demonstration only)
SELECT
  WITH ANONYMIZATION OPTIONS(epsilon=1e20, delta=.01, kappa=1)
  gender, ANON_AVG(quantity CLAMPED BETWEEN 50 AND 100) average_quantity
FROM view_on_professors
GROUP BY item;

+----------+------------------+
| item     | average_quantity |
+----------+------------------+
| scissors | 54               |
| pencil   | 58               |
| pen      | 51               |
+----------+------------------+
```

### Explicit clamping 
<a id="anon_explicit_clamping"></a>

In an anonymization aggregate function, the [`CLAMPED BETWEEN`][anon-clamp]
clause explicitly clamps the total contribution from each anonymization ID to
within a specified range.

Explicit bounds are uniformly applied to all aggregations.  So even if some
aggregations have a wide range of values, and others have a narrow range of
values, the same bounds are applied to all of them.  On the other hand, when
[implicit bounds][anon-imp-clamp] are inferred from the data, the bounds applied
to each aggregation can be different.

Explicit bounds should be chosen to reflect public information.
For example, bounding ages between 0 and 100 reflects public information
because in general, the age of most people falls within this range. However,
bounding ages between 0 and 37 because only 5% of people in the dataset are
older than 37 is a problem because it's based on the dataset, not public
information.

Important: The results of the query reveal the explicit bounds. Do not use
explicit bounds based on the dataset; explicit bounds should be based on
public information.

### Implicit clamping 
<a id="anon_implicit_clamping"></a>

In an anonymization aggregate function, the [`CLAMPED BETWEEN`][anon-clamp]
clause is optional. If you do not include this clause, clamping is implicit,
which means bounds are derived from the data itself in a differentially
private way. The process is somewhat random, so aggregations with identical
ranges can have different bounds.

Implicit bounds are determined per aggregation. So if some
aggregations have a wide range of values, and others have a narrow range of
values, implicit bounding can identify different bounds for different
aggregations as appropriate. This may be an advantage or a disadvantage
depending on your use case: different bounds for different aggregations
can result in lower error, but this also means that different
aggregations have different levels of uncertainty, which may not be
directly comparable. [Explicit bounds][anon-exp-clamp], on the other hand,
apply uniformly to all aggregations and should be derived from public
information.

When clamping is implicit, part of the total epsilon is spent picking bounds.
This leaves less epsilon for aggregations, so these aggregations are noisier.
